\section{Motivation}
\label{sec: motivation}
%
%
A physicist is always interested in the beaviour and time evolution of the observables of the investigates system.
In the middle of the last century many physicists worked on the understanding and mathematical description of one physical process, the Brownian motion.
On stochasical theory of these certain physical process is based on the Langevin equation
%
\begin{align}
	\pdv{t} \mt{A}(t) -\mt{F}_{\mt{ex}}(x,t) + \gamma \cdot \mt{A}(t) = f(t),
	\label{eq: Langevin equation}
\end{align}
%
where $\mt{A}(t)$ is some dynamical observable and $f(t)$ is a random force like white noise for example.
The origin of the second term on the left hand side is some external force result from a coupling between $\mt{A}(t)$ and some external potential.
The third term on the left hand side is a damping or friction term.
Now let us assume it's possible to seperate equation \eqref{eq: Langevin equation} into two parts.
The first part, called $f_{1}$, is a functional of the dynamical observable $\mt{A}(t')$, where $t_{0} \leq t' \leq t$, so that this part is depending on the history of A.
The second part $f_{2}$ should be depending on all other degrees of freedom.
Now $f_{1}$ is expanded up to the linear order and all terms of higher order and the part $f_{2}$ are summerized to the quantity $F(t)$.
The result is a linearized form of the Langevin equation
%
\begin{align}
	\pdv{t} \mt{A}(t) = \int\limits_{t_{0}}^{t} \dd{t'} \mathcal{C}(t-t') \mt{A}(t') + F(t),
	\label{eq: linearized Langevin equation}
\end{align}
%
where $\mathcal{C}$ is a correlation function and $\mt{A}(t')$ is the deviation of the invariant part of the Hamiltonian.
For large time scales the deviation should be vanish, so the time-integral over $\mt{A}(t')$ should be become zero.
For simplification the origin of the time axis is moved to $t_{0}$.
In general the Laplace transformation of a function is given by
%
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}\big\{\mt{A}(t)\big\} = \mt{A}(s) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \dd{t} \mt{A}(t) e^{-st}.
	\label{eq: Laplace transformation real axis}
\end{align}
%
Using the Laplace transformation equation \eqref{eq: linearized Langevin equation} becomes a algebratic equation of motion.
The solution of this equation is 
%
\begin{align}
	\mt{A}(t) = \Xi(t) \cdot \mt{A}(0) + \mt{A}'(t) \hspace{1cm} \mt{with} \hspace{1cm} \mt{A}'(t) = \int\limits_{0}^{t} \dd{t'} \Xi(t-t') F(t'),
	\label{eq: splitted observable}
\end{align}
%
where the function $\Xi(t)$ is defined by the Laplace transformation of $\Xi(s) = [s-\mathcal{C}(s)]^{-1}$ and $\mathcal{C}(s)$ is the Laplace transformtion of the correlation function $\mathcal{C}(t)$.
The main result of equation \eqref{eq: splitted observable} and the motivation for the following introduced memory-matrix-formalism is the splitting of the dynamical observable $\mt{A}(t)$ into two parts.

For the first term on the right hand side the only time-dependence is adverted through the correlation function $\mathcal{C}$, which is clear regarding the definition of $\Xi$.
This term included the linear contributions of $\mt{A}(t)$ by construction.
These ones are the mostly important contributions to the time evolutaion of an observable, because they are secular.
In contrast the second term on the right hand side is the convolution between the function $\Xi(t-t')$ and the function $\mt{F}(t')$.
The latter summerize all the non-linear effects, fluctuations and intital transient processes, which are all effects with a small lifetimes in contrast with the secular effects.
Therefore these effects shouldn't have large influences on the time evolution of an observable, always large time scales in mind.

Beside the physical interpretation a simple geometrical and mathematical one is very usefull.
Let us assume a vector space ana the observable should be a vector in this vector space.
Then the secular term is a projection on the A-axis and the non-secular term is aquivalent to a vector perpendicular to the A-axis.
The memory-matrix-formalism take up this simple interpretation of equation \eqref{eq: splitted observable} and put it in a general and exact form, so that it can be used classicaly and quantum mechanicaly.

\section{Linear Response Theory}
\label{sec: linear response theory}
%
%
Before the derivation of the memory-matrix-formalism can be started some ground work is to do.
This section begins with a short reminder of the kubo formula. %also known as linear response theory.
After that the Kubo relaxation function are introduced and some important relations between there and the retarded susceptibility $\chi$ are derivated.
In the last section finally the splitting of $\chi$ in a real and an imaginary part are dicussed.
%
%
\subsection{Kubo formula}
\label{subsec: kubo formula}
%
%
Consider a system in equilibrium represented by the Hamiltonian $H_{0}$.
At an arbitrary time $t'$ a pertubation is switched on, where the pertubation is given by the Hamiltonian $H_{1} = - B \cdot F(t)$, so that $H(t) = H_{0} + H_{1}$ is the full Hamiltonian.
Thereby $B$ is an operator by which the pertubation is coupled on the system and $F(t)$ is a function determining the time evolution of the pertubation.
It is assumed that $F(t) = 0$ for $t<t'$ so that the system is in thermal equilibrium for all these times.

The physical interest is existed in the question how does an observable $\mt{A}$ react on the pertubation switched on at $t'$.
The answer is given by the thermodynamical expectation value of the operator corresponding to the observable $\mt{A}$
%
\begin{align}
	\expval{\mt{A}}(t) := \Tr{\rho_{\mt{S}}(t) \mt{A}_{\mt{S}}} = \Tr{\rho_{\mt{I}}(t) \mt{A}_{\mt{I}}},
	\label{eq: thermodynamical expectation value}
\end{align}
%
where the label S and I stand for the SchrÃ¶dinger and Interaction picture, respectivily.
The equality of the expectation value in the different regarded pictures is shown by the invariance of the trace under cycle permutation.
The transformation into the interaction picture is very usefull what we will see after the next step below.
In quantum mechnics the time evolution of the density operator is determined by the von Neumann-equation.
%
\begin{align}
	\dv{t} \rho_{\mt{S}}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar} \comm{H(t)}{\rho_{\mt{S}}(t)} \hspace{0.5cm}\Leftrightarrow\hspace{0.5cm} \dv{t} \rho_{\mt{I}}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar} \comm{H_{1}}{\rho_{\mt{I}}(t)}
	\label{eq: von Neumann-equation}
\end{align}
%
The equation is also transformed into the interaction picture, which doesn't change the structure itself but the density operator deponds only on the Hamiltonian $H_{1}$ now.
Integrating and using the condition that the system is in thermal equilibrium at $t \to -\infty$ equation \eqref{eq: von Neumann-equation} is resulted in a integrable equation for the density operator.
%
\begin{align}
	\rho_{\mt{I}}(t) = \rho_{0} + \frac{i}{\hbar} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{t} \dd{t'} \comm{B_{\mt{I}}(t')}{\rho_{\mt{I}}(t')}F(t')
	\label{eq: integrable form of von Neumann-equation}
\end{align}
%
Jet it is clear why the interection picture is used.
The integrand depends on the Hamiltonian of the pertubation only in linear order which is a perfect starting point for a iterativ solution procedure.
Starting with the zeroth order the density operator is trivially the density operator at thermical equilibrium.
Inserting the zeroth order on the right hand side of equation \eqref{eq: integrable form of von Neumann-equation} yield the first order of the density operator, a.\,s.\o.
In linear response theory the iteration is cutted off after the first order.
Inserting this in equation \eqref{eq: thermodynamical expectation value} and defining the dynamical susceptibility 
%
\begin{align}
	\chi_{\mt{AB}}(t-t') = \frac{i}{\hbar} \Theta(t-t') \expval{\comm{A_{\mt{I}}(t-t')}{B_{\mt{I}}(0)}}_{H_{0}}
	\label{eq: dynamical susceptibilty}
\end{align}
%
yield the Kubo formula
%
\begin{align}
	\delta\expval{\mt{A}(t)} := \expval{\mt{A}}(t) - \expval{\mt{A}(t)}_{H_{0}} \approx \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd{t'} \chi_{\mt{AB}}(t-t') F(t'),
	\label{eq: Kubo formula}
\end{align}
%
where the label $H_{0}$ means that the expactation value is taken with respect to the unpertubated Hamiltonian.
We see that the deviation of the observable A caused by the pertubation is given by the convolution of the dynamical suszeptibilty $\chi_{\mt{AB}}(t-t')$ and the time evolution function $F(t)$.\todo{noch sch\"oner schreiben}
%
%
\subsection{Kubo relaxation function}
\label{subsec: Kubo relaxation function}
%
%
After a general equation for the deviation of an observable A from the equilibrium value was established, we want to investigate a certain kind of pertubation.
Let us assume $F(t) = \Theta(-t) \cdot F \cdot e^{-s\tau}$ the time evolution function of a pertubation, which is switched on adiabatically at $t=-\infty$ and switched off at $t=0$.
Inserting this in equation \eqref{eq: Kubo formula} and substituting $\tau = t-t'$ yield $\delta\expval{\mt{A}(t)} = \Phi_{AB}(t) \cdot F e^{st}$ with the Kubo relaxation function
%
\begin{align}
	\Phi_{\mt{AB}}(t) = \frac{i}{\hbar} \lim\limits_{s \to 0} \int\limits_{t}^{\infty} \dd{\tau} \expval{\comm{\mt{A}_{\mt{I}}(\tau)}{\mt{B}_{\mt{I}}(0)}}_{H_{0}} e^{-s\tau}.
\end{align}
%

The arising $\Theta$-distributions determine the lower limit of the intergal to $t$.
For a more detailed derivation of the Kubo relaxation function see \cite{Schwabl} or \cite{Schwabl2}.
