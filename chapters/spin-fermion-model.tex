\begin{itemize}
	\item explain the quantum critical point theory
	\item introduced the spin fermion model in detail used by Sachdev and me
	\item difference two other spin fermion models and why these changes are important
	\item show that the momentum is conserved and the current dosen't
	\item introduced the pertubation Hamiltonian which included umklapp scattering
	\item show that the current doesn't change and the momentum isn't anymore conserved
\end{itemize}
