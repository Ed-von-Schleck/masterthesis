\chapter{Calculation}
\label{ch: calculation}

In the last chapter the memory-matrix-formalism was introduced, which give us an exact formula to calculate correlation functions.
Now this formalism is used to determine the static conductivity of the spin-fermion-model, introduced in chapter (\todo{make link to chapter spin-fermion-model}), pertubate umklapp-scattering.


\section{Infinite conductivity in systems with unbroken translation symmetry}
\label{sec: Infinite conductivity in a system with unbroken translation symmetry}

After Drude published his theory about the electrical transport in metals \cite{Drude} in the beginning of the last century it is well known that a broken translation symmetry is needed to get a finite static conductivity.
Because of Neother's theorem it is also well known that a unbroken symmetry always implies a conserved quantity.
In the case of translation symmetry this quantity is the momentum.
Phenomenas breaking the translation symmetry are for example impurity scattering, electron-electron scattering and umklapp scattering.
Let us firstly assume the standard spin-fermion-model without a translation symmetry breaking pertubation.
In chapter (\todo{link to chapter spin-fermion-model}) it is showed that in the used model the momentum is conserved but the currunt isn't conserved.
This property is needed to calculate the static conductivity.

In general the static conductivity is given by taking the small frequencie limit of the conductivity and the conductivity itself is given by the current-current correlation function (JJ-correlation function), which reslut directly from the linear response theory.

\begin{align}
	\sigma_{\mt{dc}} = \lim\limits_{z \to 0} \sigma(z) = \lim\limits_{z \to 0}\, \beta\,\mathcal{C}_{\mt{JJ}}(z)
\end{align}
%
The memory matrix formalism is used to calculate the JJ-correlation function.
Before we can attend us to the calculation of the correlation function we have to think about the set of operators introduced by the definition of the projection operator.
This set of operators has to be choosen for each calculation seperatly depending of the model and the quantity of interest.
In our case we choose only a set of to operators namly the momentum and the current, because we want to figure out what influnece the unconserved momentum has on the current..

\begin{align}
	\mathcal{C}_{\mt{JJ}}(z) = 
		\frac{i}{\beta} \bigg[ 
			z \delta_{i\mt{J}} 
			+ 
			i \beta 
			\obra{\dot{\mt{A}}_{i}} 
			\hat{Q} \frac{i}{z - \hat{Q} \hat{L} \hat{Q}} \hat{Q} 
			\oket{\dot{\mt{A}}_{k}}
			\chi_{k\mt{J}}^{-1}
		\bigg]^{-1}
		\chi_{i\mt{J}},
