In the last chapter the memory-matrix-formalism was introduced, which give us an exact formula for correlation functions.
Now this formalism is used to determine the static conductivity of the spin-fermion-model, introduced in chapter \todo{make link to chapter spin-fermion-model}, pertubate umklapp-scattering.
